We have a few high leverage residuals. Let's take a closer look.

```{r Outlier Examination}

SortBySqFt <- C21[order(C21$GrLivArea, decreasing = TRUE),]
head(SortBySqFt)

# Wow! Two houses with >4000 square feet were sold for under $200k?? Either that's a mistake (like someone left out a zero) or I need the number of that real estate agent IMMEDIATELY so he can get me that kind of price on a mansion! If these two outliers are an valid observation, we may be looking at a short sale or foreclosure. Since these kinds of sales are not what Century 21 wants to measure, we feel confident in removing them from our dataset.

# Save complete dataset as a separate object in case we need it later
C21_full <- C21

# Find rows with outlier data
which(C21[ , 1] > 4000)

# Those are the same datapoints highlighted in our Residuals vs Leverage plot, so let's remove them.
C21 <- C21[-c(131,339),]
```
Now that we've removed the invalid data points, let's look again at the residuals.
```{r Residuals after Removing Invalid Data}
# Log-Log Model 

log_rd <- lm(logprice ~ logLivArea, data = C21)
log_g = log_rd$residuals
log_m<-mean(log_g)
log_std<-sqrt(var(log_g))
hist(log_g, density=20, breaks=20, prob=TRUE, col="red",
     xlab="Residuals",  
     main="Residual Histogram with Normal Distribution")
curve(dnorm(x, mean=log_m, sd=log_std), 
      col="darkblue", lwd=2, add=TRUE, yaxt="n")

plot(log_rd)
```
Now let's take another look at the fits
```{r Refit Model}
# Parameter Estimates
# Overall
fit = lm(logprice ~ logLivArea, data = C21)
summary(fit)
confint(fit)

# Without Lines
C21 %>% ggplot(aes(logLivArea, logprice, color = Neighborhood)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylab("Sale Price, log transformed") + 
  xlab("Living Area Sq. Footage, log transformed") + 
  ggtitle("Square Footage of Living Areas vs. Sales Price")

# By Neighborhood
fit_hoods = C21 %>% group_by(Neighborhood) %>% do(model = lm(logprice ~ logLivArea, data = .))

# Brookside
summary(fit_hoods[[2]][[1]])
confint(fit_hoods[[2]][[1]])

# Edwards
summary(fit_hoods[[2]][[2]])
confint(fit_hoods[[2]][[2]])

# North Ames
summary(fit_hoods[[2]][[3]])
confint(fit_hoods[[2]][[3]])

# With Lines for each Neighborhood
C21 %>% ggplot(aes(logLivArea, logprice, color = Neighborhood)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ylab("Sale Price, log transformed") + 
  xlab("Living Area Sq. Footage, log transformed") + 
  ggtitle("Square Footage of Living Areas vs. Sales Price")
